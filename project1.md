# Task Management System Project

## Overview

This project will guide you through creating a Task Management System using Flask, PostgreSQL, and Docker. The application will allow users to manage their tasks through a web interface, including features such as user authentication, task creation, updating, and deletion.

### Technologies Used

1. **Flask**:
    - A lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python.
    - Used for building the web server and handling HTTP requests and responses.

2. **PostgreSQL**:
    - A powerful, open-source relational database system.
    - Used for storing user and task data securely.

3. **Docker**:
    - A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.
    - Ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

4. **SQLAlchemy**:
    - An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Python.
    - Provides a high-level abstraction for interacting with the database.

### Why This Project?

This project is an excellent way to learn the fundamentals of backend development for several reasons:

1. **API and Database Interaction**:
    - You will learn how to create RESTful APIs using Flask. These APIs will handle HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and interact with the PostgreSQL database.
    - SQLAlchemy will be used to map Python objects to database tables, allowing you to perform database operations using Python code instead of raw SQL queries.
    - You'll understand how APIs serve as an intermediary between the client (frontend) and the database. When a client makes a request, the API processes the request, interacts with the database, and returns the appropriate response.

2. **User Authentication**:
    - Implementing user authentication will teach you how to securely handle user data, manage sessions, and protect routes that require authentication.
    - You'll learn about hashing passwords, generating and validating JWT tokens, and managing user sessions.

3. **CRUD Operations**:
    - By implementing CRUD operations for tasks, you'll gain a deep understanding of how to perform create, read, update, and delete operations on database records.
    - You'll learn how to design and implement RESTful APIs that correspond to these operations.

4. **Data Presentation**:
    - The project will teach you how to present data to users in a meaningful way. You'll create views and templates to display tasks, and implement features like sorting and filtering.
    - If you choose to integrate a frontend, you'll learn how to make API calls from the frontend, handle responses, and update the UI dynamically.

5. **Deployment and Containerization**:
    - Using Docker to containerize your application ensures that it runs consistently across different environments. You'll learn how to create Dockerfiles and use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications.
    - Deploying the application to AWS will give you experience with cloud services and infrastructure management.

## Project Steps

### Phase 1: Set Up the Project Environment

1. **Install Flask**:
    - Use pip to install Flask: `pip install flask`
    - Create a basic Flask application and run it to verify the installation.

2. **Set Up PostgreSQL**:
    - Install PostgreSQL and set up a new database.
    - Use a database management tool (e.g., pgAdmin) to interact with the database.

3. **Install SQLAlchemy**:
    - Use pip to install SQLAlchemy: `pip install sqlalchemy`
    - Configure SQLAlchemy to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

### Phase 2: User Authentication

1. **User Model**:
    - Define a User model with fields for username, email, and password.
    - Use SQLAlchemy to create the model and interact with the database.

2. **User Registration**:
    - Create a registration form for new users.
    - Implement backend logic to handle user registration and store user data securely.

3. **User Login**:
    - Create a login form for existing users.
    - Implement backend logic to authenticate users and maintain session state.

### Phase 3: Task Management

1. **Task Model**:
    - Define a Task model with fields for title, description, due date, and status.
    - Use SQLAlchemy to create the model and interact with the database.

2. **CRUD Operations**:
    - Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
    - Create RESTful APIs to handle these operations.

3. **Task Views**:
    - Create views and templates for displaying tasks.
    - Implement logic to filter and sort tasks based on different criteria.

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration (Optional)

1. **Basic Frontend Setup**:
    - Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a simple frontend for the application.
    - Integrate frontend with backend APIs to display and manage tasks.

2. **Advanced Features**:
    - Add features such as task prioritization, due date notifications, and task sharing.

### Phase 5: Deployment

1. **Containerization with Docker**:
    - Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
    - Use Docker Compose to manage multi-container applications, including the database.

2. **Deploy to AWS**:
    - Set up an EC2 instance and deploy the Docker containers.
    - Use AWS RDS for PostgreSQL to manage the database.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline (Optional)**:
    - Implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or another CI/CD tool.
    - Automate testing, building, and deployment of the application.

## Summary

This project will provide you with hands-on experience in backend development using Flask, PostgreSQL, and Docker. By following these steps, you will build a fully functional Task Management System, gaining valuable skills in web development, database management, and containerization.
